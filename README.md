# Aerodynamics: Wind Tunnel Practice

This repo is the home of all the files involved in my Aerodynacmics class **wind tunnel practice**. As the abstrac says:

    The data from the wind tunnel allows us to obtain some fundamental aerodynamic characteristic 
    of the NACA 0018 airfoil. Throughout this report the pressure distribution over the airfoil 
    surface will be analyzed at different angles of attack in order to get the relationship between
    its lift coefficient and the angle of attack, after that we could obtain the lift produced by the
    airfoil or a scaled real wing (thanks to the nondimensional analysis). Additionally, tunnel data 
    are compared with the numerical ones provided by the popular software tool Xfoil, thus is possible
    to carry out a comparison between the numerical model and the wind tunnel data.

In the repo you can find:

* The [**lab report**](https://github.com/PabloRdrRbl/aerodynamics_practrice/blob/master/tunel-data-adquisition-and-analysis-p-robles.pdf) I've written about the wind tunnel session we had here at the University of Le√≥n (Spain).
* The [**source code**](https://github.com/PabloRdrRbl/aerodynamics_practrice/tree/master/report) (LaTeX) of the report. I've learned a lot of LaTeX
while writing the report: please try to write something in LaTeX! If you don't want to install anything on your desktop use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), it's a great tool!
* And, the [**Python code**](https://github.com/PabloRdrRbl/aerodynamics_practrice/tree/master/scripts) (you must love Python at this point, in case you don't: learn Python!)
I've used Python to process the tunnel data and produce some nice and ready to publish plots using [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), furthermore I've managed to connect Python with
[Xfoil](http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/) (nice pice of software by the guru Mark Drela) and automatite the entire workflow when I wanted to change some parameter (Reynolds numeber was the most recurrent).
